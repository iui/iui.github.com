Repository for iUI's GitHub Organization Page(s)
================================================

This is the source code for the [iUI GitHub Organization Page](http://iui.github.com).

Purpose
-------
For now the iUI GitHub page is mostly a placeholder that provides links to the main iUI sites and to the small (but most likely growing) amount of iUI work that's being done on GitHub.

This may change in the future.

Use of Twitter's Bootstrap
--------------------------
To provide provide basic formatting for this site, we're using [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

[Sean](http://github.com/msgilligan) thinks it would be cool to create an iUI-looking version of Bootstrap so it will be easy to create matching dektop and mobile sites using iUI and the iUI theme for bootstrap.  He doesn't have time to do that right now, but if *you* think it is cool, please fork away and give it a try.
